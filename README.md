## Virtual Environment Setup
A Virtual Environment is necessary to develop and test the application. This is
performed in a safe, self-contained manner through Python's Virtual
Environment.

### 1. Initialise a Python Virtual Environment
Ensure that your current working directory contains the `requirements.txt`
file, in this case it is '/venv', then use:

`$ python -m venv venv`

NOTE: Your system may have `python3` aliased as something other than `python`

### 2. Activate the new Virtual Environment

On standard Unix operating systems this would be:

`$ source venv/bin/activate`

On Windows systems:

`$ venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file contains all the Python dependencies that the
application requires to run. These can be downloaded and installed with:

`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

NOTE: Your system may have `pip3` aliased as something other than `pip`

### 4. Start the server

To start the server and open pages in our browser, the follow command should be executed:

`python app.py`
